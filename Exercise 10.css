    <p>My Chemical Romance (commonly abbreviated to MCR or My Chem) is an American rock band from Newark, New Jersey. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, lead guitarist Ray Toro, rhythm guitarist Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. Founded by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, and Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed with Eyeball Records and released their debut album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major-label debut, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by Bob Bryar. The album was a commercial success, and it attained platinum status over a year later.</p>

    <h1>MCR's band logo meaning</h1>
    <p>These symbols – Clarity, Courage, Sacrifice, Devotion – also got their own set of fan theories as to what they might mean to MCR. ... It's decorated with several symbols not seen on the new reunion merchandise or during the band's initial reunion announcement.</p>

  <h1>MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE DYNASTY </h1>

<article>
  <div><h2>MCR JOURNEY</h2>
  <p>Debut album ‘I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love’ had been released less than a month prior, and this show – performed at seminal, now-defunct New Jersey venue Maxwell’s (part of the video for Bruce Springsteen’s 1982 single ‘Glory Days’ was filmed there; REM’s Peter Buck used to own a share in the venue) sees the band performing in front of Mikey and Gerard Way’s beloved grandmother Elena Lee Rush. It would be the one and only time Elena would see the band. Within two years she’d be dead, immortalised on the band’s classic single ‘Helena’.

    This show is also notable for guitarist Frank Iero’s dreadlocks. Iero’s dreadlocks can date My Chemical Romance performances like rings on tree trunks can date forests. If there are dreads, it was an early one.</p>

  <Div><h2>RISE OF FAME</h2>
  <p>How did MCR become famous?
    The album attracted a small underground following, and My Chemical Romance jumped to the big leagues in 2003 by signing with Reprise Records. The following year, they released Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, a platinum-selling album that featured cover art by Way himself.</p>
